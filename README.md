# Spotify_EDA

Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world.

Basic functions such as playing music are totally free, but you can also choose to upgrade to Spotify Premium.

Whether you have Premium or not, you can:

Get recommendations based on your taste
Build collections of music and podcasts
And more!

In this project, I have explored, cleaned and performed different types of functions on the given data set.
Here we have 2 datas:
1. Spotify Features
2. Tracks

Using the above 2 data, plotted different type of graphs in order to understand the different trends that has been occured so far in the music industry.
